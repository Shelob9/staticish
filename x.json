The second part gives applies those topics to WordPress plugins that add blocks to the WordPress block-based editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-wordcamp-nyc-2019\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jflePqzCnH\"><a href=\"https://2019.nyc.wordcamp.org/session/react-and-javascript-testing-in-and-around-wordpress/\">React and JavaScript Testing In And Around WordPress</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://2019.nyc.wordcamp.org/session/react-and-javascript-testing-in-and-around-wordpress/embed/#?secret=jflePqzCnH\" data-secret=\"jflePqzCnH\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;React and JavaScript Testing In And Around WordPress&#8221; &#8212; WordCamp NYC 2019\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really geeked about this talk. Testing JavaScript apps is really important. Also, a lot of fun. I also think that this next phase in WordPress development &#8212; a move to React-powered UIs that are often decoupled from WordPress is great &#8212; but requires a serious commitment to automated testing or we will not be able to meet the needs of people visiting our sites or those building them. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> A key benefit of developing blocks loosely coupled to WordPress is you can reuse the components anywhere. This is great &#8211; you spend less time developing duplicate functionality, and a more consistent user experience. The downside is if any component becomes buggy or defective it affects every client consuming it. That’s a big risk and if you’re not developing the component in every single context it’s used, then the bug or defect may not be obvious. </p><cite><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/blog/what-gutenberg-means-headlessdecoupled-cms\">&#8211; Me, in a recent guest post for Pantheon that I don&#8217;t want to just repeat the same arguments from in this post.

This is a zero-config build and testing tool for WordPress development. It works on top of Jest, Babel, webpack and other tools you need for modern JavaScript development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the easiest way to configure <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel </a>and <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">webpack </a>for WordPress development. It&#8217;s like <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started\">create-react-app</a> for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How To Add WordPress Scripts To Your Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a quick guide, the slides and the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts\">README</a>, have way more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, install:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>yarn add @wordpress/scripts</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Update package.json &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"> <br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"scripts\":&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"build\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;build\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"check-engines\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;check-engines\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"check-licenses\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;check-licenses\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"lint:css\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;lint-style\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"lint:js\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;lint-js\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"lint:pkg-json\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;lint-pkg-json\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"start\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;start\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"test:e2e\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;test-e2e\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"test:unit\":&nbsp;\"wp-scripts&nbsp;test-unit-js\"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then <a href=\"https://calderaforms.com/wordcamp-pittsburgh-2018/\">create a Gutenberg block</a> at /src/index.js. You can compile it to build/index.min.js like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>yarn build</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or do many other things, such as testing. Which I cover a lot in this talk 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see a complete example of how this all works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Shelob9/testing-react-wordpress\">this example code plugin I put on Github for this talk</a>. Also, so I can use it as a template for when I have to make a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How To Use WordPress e2e Testing Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin and the talk cover automated browser testing with the WordPress end to end testing tools. This could have been its own talk. I did want to have a complete example of how to set up the local development environment and <a href=\"https://github.com/Shelob9/testing-react-wordpress/tree/master/e2e\">configure Jest for these tests.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qaRqtxml6B\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/27/introducing-the-wordpress-e2e-tests/\">Introducing the WordPress e2e tests</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/27/introducing-the-wordpress-e2e-tests/embed/#?secret=qaRqtxml6B\" data-secret=\"qaRqtxml6B\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Introducing the WordPress e2e tests&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Slides And Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://shelob9.github.io/testing-javascript-in-and-around-wordpress/\">View Slides</a></li><li><a href=\"https://shelob9.github.io/testing-javascript-in-and-around-wordpress/presentation.pdf\">Download Slides As PDF</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Shelob9/testing-javascript-in-and-around-wordpress\">Source Code For Slides</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example Code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Shelob9/testing-react-apps\">Example Code For Part One</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Shelob9/testing-react-wordpress\">Example Code For Part Two</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>BTW I Used MDX-Deck, It Is Good.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is an off-topic aside about making the slide deck. Because, Josh.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I normally use Google slides. I&#8217;m never happy with how code looks, if its pasted in as text. With a lot of effort, I&#8217;ve gotten it to look good with screenshots. That makes the code invisible to users who do not load images and you can&#8217;t cut and paste the code from the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I started thinking about how I wished I could just write it in markdown. <a href=\"https://mdxjs.com/\">MDX </a>mixes React JSX and markdown. It&#8217;s really ideal for writing about code and <a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck\">mdx-deck</a> wraps it up in a slide presentation. Very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best part is, I wrote it in vsCode. The syntax highlighting and automatic code formatting in vsCode is much better than in Google Slides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, it would be way better if I used a monorepo to store the example code and the deck in the same repo.

Sounds simple, but the &#8220;and then&#8221; part of that sentence includes a lot of complexity. That is because when you make an HTTP request &#8212; it is performed asynchronously. This applies to jQuery AJAx, fetch, Axios, Nodes&#8217;s HTTPS module, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to cover callbacks and promises. I want to ask you to forget about all that and learn two rules. With those rules, and a modern JavaScript runtime, you can write a function that solves the requirement I gave before in a few, highly readable lines, using <code>async</code>/ <code>await</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say highly-readable because what I love about <code>async</code>/ <code>await</code> is that you can read the code and get a much easier sense of what is going on. Instead of understanding then/when/catch/error/whatever, you see the request on one line and on the next line you see what is done with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to give you two basic rules of <code>async</code>/ <code>await</code> and some practical examples of their use. It&#8217;s a hard to explain this concept, but the code is short and readable, so you should be comfortable, when you&#8217;re done to start experimenting with this new API.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rule One Of Aysnc/ Await</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You Must Use The <code>await</code> Keyword Only In Closure That Is Declared With The <code>async</code></em> keyword.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler\">\n<div class=\"oembed-gist\"><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37.js?file=1.js\"></script><noscript>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37\">Gist</a>.</noscript></div>\n<figcaption>Inside of this closure, we may use <code>await</code>because the <code>async</code> keyword is used when declaring the function.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The await keyword is the real magic of async/ await. Before you can use it &#8211;see rule two &#8212; you must know rule one. Rule one shows us how to create closure that can use the <code>await</code> keyword. How? We type the <code>async</code> keyword before a function. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got that? That&#8217;s rule one, you&#8217;ll see examples when I explain rule two under the next heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rule Two</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Inside Of An <code>async</code> Closure, If Another <code>async</code> Function Is called With The <code>await</code> Keyword, The Next Line Will Not Run Until That Line&#8217;s Promise Has Resolved.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler\">\n<div class=\"oembed-gist\"><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37.js?file=2.js\"></script><noscript>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37\">Gist</a>.</noscript></div>\n<figcaption>In this example, line 7 will not run until the Promise created on line 6 has been resolved or rejected.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, I&#8217;m using the fetch API, which creates a promise. That&#8217;s all been made invisible by using await. Instead of using a <code>then()</code> callback, I&#8217;m just awaiting the result of the function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice that the before I declare the function I used the <code>async</code> keyword. That&#8217;s another example of how rule one works. This function says <code>async</code> in front of it, so I can use <code>await</code> inside of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use this asynchronous function only inside of another asynchronous function. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler\">\n<div class=\"oembed-gist\"><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37.js?file=3.js\"></script><noscript>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37\">Gist</a>.</noscript></div>\n<figcaption>Inside of an <code>async</code> function, we can <code>await</code> the results of an <code>async</code> function.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more complete example, here is a more abstract version of <code>getMostRecentPost()</code> that works with any site and then another function that calls it twice and after awaiting those results, returns both posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler\">\n<div class=\"oembed-gist\"><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37.js?file=4.js\"></script><noscript>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/252011dff617b0fb9239865c6a045a37\">Gist</a>.</noscript></div>\n<figcaption>One <code>async</code> function calling another <code>async</code> function using <code>await</code>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-david-walsh-blog\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3al4VsX6zz\"><a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/fetch\">fetch API</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://davidwalsh.name/fetch/embed#?secret=3al4VsX6zz\" data-secret=\"3al4VsX6zz\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;fetch API&#8221; &#8212; David Walsh Blog\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>That&#8217;s The Whole API!

Depending on the project, I either use <a href=\"https://docs.devwithlando.io/\">Lando</a> or docker-compose. This post is about Lando.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lando, is no <a href=\"https://serverpress.com/\">DesktopServer</a>. DesktopServer gives you a simple GUI for creating WordPress sites. Lando has no user interface, you do everything from the command line. That&#8217;s good or bad, depending on what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article explains how I create new sites for local development using Lando. You can see my current .lando file that I use for Caldera Forms development <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Shelob9/e103a1836efcfbffaa17d104d7ce774a#file-lando-yml\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create The WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initialize lando in current directory:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>lando init --recipe=wordpress</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Add a WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wp core download</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That downloaded WordPress core and setup wp config to match Lando&#8217;s default variables:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wp config create --dbname=wordpress --dbuser=wordpress --dbpass=wordpress --dbhost=database --skip-check</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Add <g class=\"gr_ gr_27 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"27\" data-gr-id=\"27\">xdebug</g> and <g class=\"gr_ gr_42 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"42\" data-gr-id=\"42\">MailHog</g> and phpunit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Optional step, but it&#8217;s best before going further to add phpunit, MailHog and <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">xdebug</g>. <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">MailHog</g> intercepts all emails coming from the application and provides a webmail-like UI for reading the caught emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love xdebug, I can&#8217;t imagine PHP development without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to run tests &#8220;The WordPress Way&#8221; you need phpunit installed globally. I disagree with this approach, but Lando makes it pretty simple to do, so fuck it. Here is a .lando.yml file that adds all of these things:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>name: formcalderas\nrecipe: wordpress\nconfig:\n  env: dev\n  xdebug: true\nproxy:\n  mailhog:\n    - mail.formcalderas.lndo.site\nservices:\n  appserver:\n    composer:\n      phpunit/phpunit: '*'\n  mailhog:\n      type: mailhog\n      hogfrom:\n        - appserver\n      portforward: true</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Containers And Start the site</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>lando start</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This builds the new site and then shows URLs for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-11.45.32-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4094\" srcset=\"https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-11.45.32-AM.png 414w, https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-11.45.32-AM-300x220.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point you have a WordPress at the URL listed for &#8220;APPSERVER URLS&#8221;.

We git commit the Lando config file in the repo for the site. That way we have a shared environment and can pull database and file changes using Lando&#8217;s CLI, <a href=\"https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/pantheon.html\">thanks to their Pantheon integration.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/wordpress.html\">Learn more about Lando + WordPress here.</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to create a Docker-based local environment using Lando.</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":4100,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[37,17],"tags":[224,100,151],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/4092"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=4092"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/4092/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/media/4100"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=4092"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=4092"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://joshpress.net/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=4092"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":4074,"date":"2018-09-04T08:29:09","date_gmt":"2018-09-04T12:29:09","guid":{"rendered":"http://joshpress.net/?p=4074"},"modified":"2018-09-03T16:31:40","modified_gmt":"2018-09-03T20:31:40","slug":"a-listicle-of-laravel-nova-related-blog-posts","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://joshpress.net/a-listicle-of-laravel-nova-related-blog-posts/","title":{"rendered":"A Listicle Of Laravel Nova Related Blog Posts"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>This is my list of all of the useful articles I found while experimenting with the Laravel Nova.

I deserve it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happens for two reasons. One reason is I underestimate the understanding that the person has more experience and knowledge then I think. The other is I don&#8217;t take the time to think through how to solve the problem before declaring it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s stick with option one, short post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multi-Tasking Is Hard AF</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m writing this on my way to the office. I take the bus, which is great as it ads 4 extra walks to my day. It&#8217;s raining, I don&#8217;t have a small umbrella for the umbrella pocket in my bag. I don&#8217;t have a light-weight jacket with a hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m doing better when I first started going to an office &#8212; after over 5 years if working from home. I now check the bus schedules before I leave and I&#8217;m almost always on time for the bus. I even check the weather &#8212; hey I brought a hoodie today 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So I&#8217;m New At This&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m doing something new, and I&#8217;m trying to be kind to myself as I stumble through it. I do wonder if I work too much as a way to avoid doing the things I&#8217;m uncomfortable with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used moving to Pittsburgh as my excuse to start leaving the house more. It gave me tons of anxiety at first. That anxiety lead to silly mistakes, which made the experience and anxiety worse. It&#8217;s easy to stay caught in that feedback loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that&#8217;s great about my job is I spend a large part of my day writing code. Something I&#8217;m good at. Something that gives me a great sense of calm to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Always Itterate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I catch myself listing steps for household tasks&#8230; Clean up after meal, reduce mess : put dishes in sink, rinse dishes, put dishes in dishwater, push in chair, wipe down table&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve taken the first rule &#8212; in my mind &#8212; of programing to heart. Before you write code, understand the problem and map a solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that taking a structured approach to self-improvement is not a revolutionary new approach to life. But being mindful of how I <em>have</em> to approach things that others may think are simple as a complete novice, I think that helps</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think you can find that empathy for <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert sel gr_spell gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">beginners</g> by doing the thing you&#8217;re good at. I think it comes through struggling through the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good thing about this theory is it works better if when I make mistakes I don&#8217;t go to putting myself down right away and instead be forgiving of my own lack of skill or experience.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a blog post about making easy things, not hard.

Change makes people scared, that&#8217;s natural. Not all of that fear, in my opinion, matches up with the reality of what Gutenberg actually does and does not do. But, its a big change with some very real risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What WordCamp Montreal Taught Me</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I attended WordCamp Montreal recently. Besides how great the vegan food was in Montreal I had two big <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert sel gr_spell gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\"><g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">take</g>aways</g>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, industry veterans are excited about the possibility of Gutenberg and are also very worried about the transition. I think some of that is people still not understanding that Gutenberg WordPress 5.0 doesn&#8217;t change existing content. But also, there are some valid concerns there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My other big set of takeaways was from <a href=\"http://simianuprising.com/2018/08/11/buddhist-guide-to-wordpress/\">a talk</a> by <a href=\"http://jerclarke.org\">Jer Clarke</a> about Buddhism and WordPress. This was <a href=\"http://simianuprising.com/2018/08/11/buddhist-guide-to-wordpress/\">a great talk</a>. It was not heavy on WordPress content but did make light of the how everything including WordPress changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It reminded me of how many times I&#8217;ve told people something like, &#8220;I used to be so stressed about technical debt and not having enough time for everything I want to build and not making enough money. Now, I&#8217;ve got technical debt, not enough time and not enough money.&#8221; Then they look at me as if I have something else to add, and I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m just more at peace with the fact that these things are happening and less attached to worrying about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still break down and cry, but way less often. I also meditate and exercise every day. I think it helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-slideshare wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-slideshare\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/3ku71kuyod9AIT\" width=\"427\" height=\"356\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/jeremyclarke/a-buddhist-guide-to-wordpress-development-wcmtl-2018-109557279\" title=\"A Buddhist Guide to WordPress Development - WCMTL 2018\" target=\"_blank\">A Buddhist Guide to WordPress Development &#8211; WCMTL 2018</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/jeremyclarke\" target=\"_blank\">Jer Clarke</a></strong> </div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>What About The Gutes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Gutenberg is a big deal. My big concern, as someone whose business is based on WordPress&#8217; huge market share, is that Gutenberg will lead to a shrinking size of the available customers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Squarespace. Also the rise in Laravel-backed CMS and CMS-like tools like <a href=\"https://nova.laravel.com/\">Nova</a>. Also, serverless static site platforms like <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> are getting more CMS-like features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the scenario where distributed web apps backed by <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">an E<g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">therum</g>-lik</g>e blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some <g class=\"gr_ gr_28 gr-alert sel gr_spell gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"28\" data-gr-id=\"28\">Disappointing</g> Things Will Happen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been very concerned about what happens when folks, who chose WordPress based on its promise of backwards compatibility, have to chose between paying to fix problems created by Gutenberg and paying for a new site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people own websites that they do not maintain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder why we in the community are so attached to supporting those who do not expect to have to support their own sites. That&#8217;s their free choice, and if they leave WordPress when faced with this responsibility is that such a bad thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>I Don&#8217;t Know Anything</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe everything will go better than we fear. Maybe Gutenberg really is what WordPress needs to stay relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no fucking clue. But I do know that, right now using WordPress, without Gutenberg, to create content is painful. Fearing what happens when you update is scary. These are all know threats to the WordPress ecosystem. They are are real and scary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things are changing and that&#8217;s difficult and scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also</strong>, <strong>the sky is blue</strong> and no one is forcing you to update. Classic editor or staying on 4.x might be the best solution for existing sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I so hope it goes well.

After a few days, I had a few concerns about the experience of authoring content in Gutenberg.  I&#8217;m used to writing mainly in Google Docs and Google Keep or Twitter. Sometimes in Simple Note and <g class=\"gr_ gr_17 gr-alert sel gr_spell gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"17\" data-gr-id=\"17\">occasionally</g> WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out that a lot of these concerns I had are being addressed. The solutions are there, but not obvious. Here are a few tips I&#8217;ve learned to improve the content writing experience. When I&#8217;m writing, not editing, Gutenberg can feel like <g class=\"gr_ gr_10 gr-alert sel gr_spell gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"10\" data-gr-id=\"10\">it is</g> in the way, but there are good features that exist or are being worked on to solve this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Slash Commands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that bothered me a lot about writing with Gutenberg In <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">my first</g> week of my new Gutenberg challenge was adding a heading block. I found that having to go to block inserter to add the heading really upset my writing flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Twitter, Kevin pointed out that you can use a slash command to bring up the block inserter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do slash commands help here?

On the handbook site this week I was documenting setting up local development for <a href=\"https://calderaforms.com\">CalderaForms.com</a> and needed to use code formatting on some words in a sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no <em>obvious way</em> to add &lt;code> or &lt;pre> to selected words in paragraph or list block. This made writing those docs a pain, I had to add the HTML in the code editor. Yes there is a code block, but switching blocks upsets my flow and sometimes I want to put code in a sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wrapping any text with ` marks will automatically do a &lt;code&gt; wrap within a paragraph or list block.

Click that to close the Gutenberg sidebar when you&#8217;re writing. It&#8217;s better that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use The Document Outline Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft is-resized\"><img src=\"https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-25-at-8.47.49-AM-300x223.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-25-at-8.47.49-AM-300x223.png 300w, https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-25-at-8.47.49-AM-768x571.png 768w, https://joshpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-25-at-8.47.49-AM.png 931w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Using the document outline in Gutenberg to see that your 10 items listicle only has 4 items.
